## 🚀 Overview

Koosi (meaning "remember" in Cameroonian Limbum) is an open-source platform for creating blockchain-powered digital time capsules that unlock based on real-world conditions. Unlike simple scheduled messages, Koosi enables truly smart triggers that respond to life events, relationship milestones, and group consensus.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Triggers**: Messages that respond to real-life events, not just dates
- **Group Coordination**: Multi-party consensus for message release
- **Emergency Protocols**: Dead man's switch and backup release mechanisms
- **Privacy First**: End-to-end encryption and selective sharing
- **Beautiful UI**: Immersive 3D visualization and smooth animations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.1, TypeScript 4.9
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js, React Three Fiber
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5.3
- **Blockchain**: Cardano (planned)
- **Enterprise Integration**: Hyperledger Firefly (planned)
- **Storage**: IPFS (planned)
